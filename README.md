# image-processing
This folder contains fundamental image processing techniques implemented using **OpenCV** and **Python**.  
Each script demonstrates a specific operation with visualization and saves the results for easy comparison.

#Techniques Included

- Grayscale Conversion → Converts color images into grayscale format.
- 
- Histogram Equalization → Enhances image contrast by spreading intensity values.  
- Edge Detection → Detects edges using Sobel, Laplacian, and Canny operators.  
- Thresholding → Segments images using simple, adaptive, and Otsu’s thresholding.  
- Image Blurring → Smooths images using Average, Gaussian, Median, and Bilateral filtering.  
- Resize & Rotate → Demonstrates basic geometric transformations.
